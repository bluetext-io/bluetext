  add-frontend:
    info: |
      Creates a frontend project (with bun+shadcn+react-router v7) at the supplied path.
      Always use this when creating a new frontend project.
      This also adds and runs a Polytope module that runs the frontend in dev mode in a container
      (with full hot reload including for dependency changes) together with an associated service.
      Another Polytope module is created for adding dependencies in the subproject.

      - id: path
        info: Path to the template to scaffold.

      Always use this when creating a new backend service.
      This also adds and runs a Polytope module that runs the backend in dev mode in a container.
